# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to illustrate the computations and some features of the forward pass in GeniePath.  The method is described in the [2019 AAAI paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00910.pdf) by Liu et al.

Computations are done at the level of matrix multiplication, without using deep learning libraries.  We also illustrate the isomorphic-invariance property.

# Code
The code is written in `R` and uses the libraries `hashmap` and `igraph`.
